# Package Manager

## Debian/Ubuntu

* [apt - Advanced Package Tool](http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt)
  * APT is a management system for software packages. Originally written for Debian and the deb package format, APT was ported and became APT-RPM to manage the **\*rpm**(8)* package format. APT-RPM can be used by any RPM-based distribution, such as Conectiva, Red Hat, SUSE, ALT-Linux, etc.

    For further information on how to use APT, refer to **\*apt-get**(8)* or visit [http://apt-rpm.org/](http://apt-rpm.org/).

  * [apt@launchpad](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt)
* [apt-get - APT package handling utility - command-line interface](http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get)
  * **apt-get** is the command-line tool for handling packages, and may be considered the user's "back-end" to other tools using the APT library. Several "front-end" interfaces exist, such as synaptic and aptitude.
